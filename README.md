# Project 01 – Comments on what I added to my first project.

- I used my original cave story from the first exercise and expanded it into a full interactive fiction.
- Added more than eight knots to grow the story, should be ten in total.
	- cave_mouth – starting area and main loop point
	- torch_pickup – player picks up the torch and upgrades strength
	- east_tunnel – dark tunnel leading deeper into the cave
	- east_tunnel_lit – lit version of the east tunnel
	- potion_room – room with potions and a bad choice
	- west_tunnel – alternate tunnel path
	- cursed_chamber – room with symbols and gated choices
	- curse_broken – result of breaking the curse
	- witch_lair – final confrontation with the witch
	- bad_ending – losing ending
- Included a major choice between different paths that changes the outcome.
- Added a loop so the player can return to the cave entrance.
- Added an item (torch) that affects available choices and endings.
- Added a strength stat that increases and unlocks certain options.
- Changed descriptions when the player revisits certain areas.
